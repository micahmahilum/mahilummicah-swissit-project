    <h1>WhyI like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
    <p><b>Swimming</b> is my <u>most favorite</u> activity in the <b>summer</b>. 
        When the <i>sun</i> is shining, and the <i>air</i> is warm, you will find me dipping 
        into my <b><i>backyard pool</i></b>. <u><i>It’s not an impressive pool</i></u>, only <i><b>three feet deep</b></i>, 
        but it’s mine.</p>
