    <h1>Who ruled Egypt?</h1>
    <p>The king of Egypt was called the pharaoh.  
        The Egyptians believed that their sun god RE was the first king of Egypt, and 
        that all the pharaohs after him were his relatives.  
        This made the pharaoh very holy â€“and very powerful!  The people thought  he was a god on Earth. </p>
