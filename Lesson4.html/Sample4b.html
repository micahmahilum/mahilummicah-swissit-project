    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
        <p>There are lots of different dinosaurs.  
        Scientists have already named about  300 kinds, and new ones are being found all the time.  
        Some dinosaurs were big, others were tiny.  Some were fierce meat-eaters,  
        others were gentle vegetarians which browsed on plants. </p>
