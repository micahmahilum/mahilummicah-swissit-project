            <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
            <p>There are lots of different dinosaurs.  
                Scientists hav e already named about 300 kinds, and new ones are being found all the time.  
                Some dinosaurs were big, others were tiny.  
                Some were fierce meat-eaters, others were gentle v egetarians which browsed on plants.</p>
