    <h1>Egyptians</h1>
    <p>We call  the <b>Egyptians</b> ancient because they lived such a long time ago â€“not because 
        they all reached a ripe old age!  The first Egyptians were farmers about 8,000 years ago.  
        Within a few thousand years, Egypt had become one of the most powerful countries in the world. </p>
