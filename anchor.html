    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
    <h2>There are lots of different dinosaurs.  
        Scientists have already named about 300 kinds, and new ones are being found all the time.  
        Some dinosaurs were big, others were tiny.  
        Some were fierce meat-eaters, others were gentle vegetarians which browsed on plants. </h2>
        <h2>Dinosaurs lived millions and millions of years ago.  The first ones appeared about 230 million years ago, 
            and the last ones we knew about died out over 65 millions years ago.  
            Compared to this, human history is just a hiccup –we’ve only been around for the last 2 million years.</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Dinosaurs were reptiles.  Today,reptilesinclude lizards, crocodiles, tortoises and snakes. </h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Like most other reptiles, dinosaurs lived on land and had dry scaly skin. 
                Their eggs had leathery shells, unlike birds’ eggs which are hard and brittle</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Tyrannosaurus was a huge meat-eater.   
                    At about 6 metreshigh, it stood three times taller than a grizzly bear.  
                    Its mouth was huge,  too –big enough to swallow you whole! </h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>The name Tyrannosaurus means tyrant lizard.  A tyrant is a cruel king.  
                    Many people think Tyrannosaurus could have run as fast as 50 kilometers an hour when chasing a meal.</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2 id="last">There may have been even bigger meat-eaters than Tyrannosaurus.  
                        This tall dinosaur is call the Deinocheirus.  We have to guess what it looked like, 
                        as we’ve only found its arms and clawed hands.  But these are bigger than a grown man, 
                        so the dinosaur must have been very enormous.</h2>
