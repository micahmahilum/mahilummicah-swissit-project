            <p>Fiction has the ability to help a person understand another person in a way that even television cannot. 
              Fiction readers not only experience the protagonist's point of view, but his innermost thoughts. 
              Fiction also allows readers to experience new settings. Not just sights and sounds, but smells, tastes, and touches.</p>
