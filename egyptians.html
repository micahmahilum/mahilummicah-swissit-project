    <h1>Why were the Egyptians great?</h1>
    <p>The Egyptians were so good at farming that they became very rich.  
        They built fantastic temples for their gods, and huge pointed tombs called pyramids where they bury their kings.

        Their priests studied the stars and their craftspeople made beautiful things from gold and silver.</p>
